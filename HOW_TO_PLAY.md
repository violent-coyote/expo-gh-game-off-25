# How to Play - Expo Game

## Your Role: The Expeditor

You are the **Expo** (Expeditor) - the most critical position in a restaurant kitchen. Your job is to coordinate the timing between multiple cooking stations to ensure all dishes for a table arrive perfectly together. Think of yourself as the conductor of a culinary orchestra!

---

## The Goal

**Serve every table with all their dishes arriving at the same time.** When dishes are sent together, tables are happy and you score big points. Let dishes arrive separately or sit too long on the pass, and your score suffers.

## How It Works

### 1. **Tables & Tickets**
- Tables arrive at your restaurant and need to be served
- Each table gets a **Ticket** showing what they ordered
- Tickets are divided into **Courses** (appetizers, mains, desserts, etc.)
- Tables must finish eating one course before the next can be fired

### 2. **Fire Dishes**
- Press the **Fire** button next to each dish to send it to the kitchen
- Different dishes take different amounts of time to cook
- **Timing is everything** - fire dishes so they all finish cooking at the same time!
- You can fire individual dishes or use **Fire the Board** to fire everything at once

### 3. **The Pass**
- When dishes finish cooking, they appear on **The Pass** (the counter where cooked food waits)
- Each dish has a **Die Timer** - if it sits too long, it "dies" (gets cold/soggy) and can't be served
- Watch the progress bars to see how much time each dish has left!

### 4. **Walking & Table Selection**
- Mark dishes as **Walking** when they're ready to go to a table (click the Walking button)
- The **Table Menu** is always visible on screen
- Click any available table to send all walking dishes to that table
- The dishes are delivered and the table starts eating!

### 5. **Course Pacing**
- After a table finishes eating their course, the next course unlocks
- Fire the next course and repeat the process
- Complete all courses to finish the table's service

## Key Terminology

### **Expo (Expeditor)**
*That's you!* The person who coordinates timing and communication between all kitchen stations.

### **Ticket**
An order for a table showing all the dishes they want, organized by courses.

### **Course**
A group of dishes served together (like appetizers, mains, or desserts). All dishes in a course should arrive at the table at the same time for maximum points.

### **Fire**
To send a dish order to a cooking station to start preparation. "Fire Table 4!" means start cooking Table 4's order.

### **The Pass**
The counter where finished dishes wait to be picked up and delivered. In professional kitchens, the expo stands at the pass and coordinates everything.

### **Walking**
Marking a dish as ready for delivery. "Burger's walking!" means the burger is heading to the table.

### **Table Selection**
Clicking a table from the always-visible table menu delivers all walking dishes to that table. Table buttons are disabled while tables are eating, then re-enabled when they're ready for the next course.

### **Die Timer**
How long a finished dish can sit on the pass before it becomes unservable. Hot food gets cold, cold food gets warm - timing matters!

### **Station**
A cooking area specializing in certain dishes (Grill, Sauté, Pantry, etc.). Each station works independently.

### **Fire the Board**
Fire all available dishes from all tickets at once. Use this when you want to start cooking everything currently available.

## Scoring

### **Perfect Timing = Maximum Points**
- All dishes sent to a table **together** = **Perfect course bonus!**
- Dishes sent within 5 seconds = Good timing
- Dishes arriving more than 5 seconds apart = Point penalties

### **Score Factors:**
- ✅ **Synchronization** - Dishes arriving together
- ✅ **Speed** - Quick service without letting dishes die
- ✅ **Table completion** - Finishing all courses successfully
- ❌ **Dead dishes** - Dishes that sat too long (major penalty!)
- ❌ **Staggered service** - Dishes arriving at different times

---

## Pro Tips

### **Master the Timing**
- Study how long each dish takes to cook
- Fire slow-cooking items first, then quick items
- Aim for all dishes to finish cooking within seconds of each other

### **Watch the Pass**
- Monitor die timers closely
- Don't let dishes sit - mark them Walking as soon as possible
- Use the progress bars to prioritize which dishes need attention

### **Course Strategy**
- Don't fire the next course until the table is eating
- Plan ahead while tables are eating their current course
- Balance multiple tables at different stages

### **Use Your Tools**
- Speed controls (1x, 2x, 3x) help you practice and test timing
- Fire the Board is powerful but requires all dishes to be ready
- The Menu Menu lets you fire any dish independently of tickets

### **Communication Flow**
Think like a real expo: 
1. "Fire the apps!" (Start the appetizer course)
2. Monitor cooking progress across all stations
3. "Walking on the salads!" (Dishes ready to go)
4. "Table 4!" (Select and deliver to the table)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Firing everything at once** - Quick-cooking dishes will die waiting for slow ones  
❌ **Forgetting die timers** - Cooked dishes can't wait forever  
❌ **Ignoring course order** - Tables need to eat before the next course  
❌ **Random table assignment** - Make sure dishes go to the right table!

## Remember

**You control the flow of the entire restaurant.** Every dish, every table, every course goes through you. Master the timing, coordinate the stations, and keep those plates moving. That's what it means to run the pass!
